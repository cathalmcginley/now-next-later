NowNextLater
============

NowNextLater is a web-app for to-do lists with dependencies.

When you put together a list of things to do, there will naturally be
some tasks that require another task to be completed first. Rather
than having to organize your task lists in projects and sub-projects,
NowNextLater allows you to mark the dependency requirement between
tasks, and then view all your tasks so that you can immediately see
which ones you can get a start on right now, which are only blocked by
a single level of things to do, and which have a deeper tree of
prerequisites blocking further action.
