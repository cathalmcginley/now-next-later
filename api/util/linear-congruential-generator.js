/** 
A Linear Congruential Generator creates a pseudo-random sequence defined by
 X[n+1] = (a . X[n] + c) mod m
    where
 m    :: 0 < m           (the modulus)
 a    :: 0 < a < m       (the multiplier)
 c    :: 0 <= c < m      (the increment)
 X[0] :: 0 <= X[0] < m   (the seed, or start value)


As described by Wikipedia
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator):

"the mixed congruential generator will have a full period for all seed
 values if and only if":

 * m and c "are relatively prime"
 * (a-1) "is divisible by all prime factors of m"
 * (aâˆ’1) "is divisible by 4 if m is divisible by 4"


An excellent video which describes this algorithm clearly is here:
